Welcome adventurer, your goal is to climb the tower and defeat the various monsters in there.
You just entered the tower, have fun! (Right click on the door to interact with it.)
You walk through the door and spot something.
You venture beyond the likes of a goblin but that is not the end.... A skeleton rises.
You enter a dim dungeon. You spot a warden at the end of the hallway.
You have finally found a way up. Something seems to lurk in the shadows.
You have reached the top of the dungeon. What kind of creature is that?
