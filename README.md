#Climb the Tower DA336A Projekt Grupp 20

Climb the Tower by answering questions about maths!
On each level of the tower, you will face dangerous foes.
They can only be harmed through the magic of mathematics. 
Can you make your way up all 20 floors of the tower?

**Getting Started**

You will need to have IntelliJ installed and open the project in it.

To start a new game, click on "New Game".
To create a new profile, click on "Add" and enter a new name.
Select the profile you want to use and click on "Select".
Select the difficulty you want to try.
You have now started a new game.

**How To Play**

To proceed between levels, click the black arrow at the top of the screen.
This arrow will appear whenever there is no enemy on the screen.
Right-click on characters and objects, such as a monster or the shopkeeper, and select
an option to interact with them.
This is how you start fights with monsters.

During a fight, the monster will ask you a maths question with 4 possible answers.
You only have a certain amount of time to answer.
If you answer incorrectly or let the timer run out, you will lose 1 heart.
When you lose all of your hearts, it is game over, and you will have to start from
the beginning.
However, if you answer correctly, then the monster loses 1 skull. 
When the monster loses all their skulls, they will be defeated, and you can continue
to the next level.

Every 5th level is a boss level.
Bosses have more health, ask harder questions, and you lose 2 hearts for every wrong answer.

**Shop and Items**

After every boss, you will get prompted if you want to go to the shop.
In the shop you can buy items to help you.
You get coins from defeating enemies.
Except for Health, all items will be consumed and activated when the icon is clicked on in
the lower right.
You can only hold one of each item at a time.
When you are finished shopping, you can exit by clicking the arrow at the top of the screen.

Health will instantly restore your health by 1 heart to a maximum of 10.

The Damage Potion (potion icon) will double your damage for 1 enemy.

The Shield (shield icon) will block all damage from 1 attack.

The Hint (light bulb icon) will remove an incorrect answer.

**Maths Questions and Difficulties**

Every monster has their own type of questions they will ask.
These are different for each of the difficulties.

*EASY* : the questions are based on what a Swedish middle school (h√∂gstadie) student has
been taught.

*MEDIUM* : the questions are based on what a Swedish high school (gymnasie) student has
been taught.

*HARD* : the questions are based on what a Swedish high school (gymnasie) student has
been taught, but with harder and more advanced questions.

**Help**

If you want help during the game, then the question mark in the lower right brings up
a help window.
Here you can find how to play, the controls, and what each symbol means.
