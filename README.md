**Walkthrough**

In the main menu, you cannot start the game without first creating a profile. Click 
"Profiles" to get to the Profiles menu. Click "Add" and type in the name you want. Then, 
click the name you just wrote and click on "Select". Now, you can click "Back" to return 
the main menu.

To start a new game, click on "New Game". Only the "Medium" difficulty can be selected. 
Now, a new game has been started. Click the arrow at the top of the screen to meet the 
first enemy. Each enemy asks you math questions of a specific type.

To start combat right-click on the enemy and select "Attack". You will see a question, 
4 answers, and the timer will start ticking down. Select the correct answer to deal 1 
damage to the enemy. A wrong answer or letting the time run out will deal 1 damage to 
you. Right or wrong, you will get a new question to answer. When the enemy's health
goes to 0, you will come to the next enemy. Alternatively, when your own health goes
to 0, you will get a game over and get sent back to the beginning.

Every 5th level is a boss level. Bosses have more health and deal 2 damage per wrong
answer. The 20th level is the final boss level, who asks you random math question types.

After every boss, you will get prompted if you want to go to the shop. In the shop you
can buy items to help you. You get coins from defeating enemies. Health will instantly
restore your health by 1 heart. The damage potion will double your damage for 1 enemy.
When you are finished, exit the shop by clicking the arrow at the top of the screen.
