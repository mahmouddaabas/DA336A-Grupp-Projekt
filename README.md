#Climb the Tower DA336A Projekt Grupp 20

Climb the Tower by answering questions about maths! On each level of the tower, 
you will face dangerous foes. They can only be harmed through the magic of mathematics. 
Can you make your way up all 25 floors of the tower?

**Walkthrough**

On the start screen, left-click the arrow at the top of the screen to begin your 
journey up the tower. Right-click the door and select an option. The "Enter" option will 
take you to your first enemy. Right-click this enemy and select "Attack" to begin combat. 
You will be asked a basic addition question. Choose the correct answer to win. If you 
answer incorrectly, then you will lose one heart. Lose all hearts and its game over. You 
can also lose hearts by letting the timer run out (the timer is currently only shown in
the console and letting it run out does not actually damage you). After the enemy is 
defeated, you can proceed up to the next level. There are currently three levels in the 
game, and beating the last level stops you from progressing further.

In the final release, it is expected to be 25 levels and that the enemies will not die 
after just one correct answer.

**Known Issues**

Right-clicking an enemy is not disabled during combat.

When continuing from a game over causes the questions to start from the enemy you died to
instead of from the beginning.

If the timer reaches 0, then it does not start again.
